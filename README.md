# City-Miles

Submission to Virtual Global Hackathon for team Tangerine Alert

The program will require input of grid references to locations in UberLand. In production, this input would come via RFID on arbitrary kiosks and scanners, but for testing will simply be inputs in the form "[xCoord], [yCoord]" with a range from 0 to 1000 for each value.
